  <p>
    I have a pet animal. My pet animal is a cat. Her name is <strong>Kitty</strong>.
    She has a long tail. She has four kittens. They all are very cute. 
    All of them are white in colour. Fishis her favourite food. I give
    her milk every day. She can climb the trees. She likes to play
    my bed. I like to play with my Kitty. I love her very much.

  <h2>Point to note:</h2>
  <p>Pets are nothing less than a part of the family. They give unconditional love to their owners. 
    In fact, these days the term “owner” is fading. People consider their pets as their children and 
    themselves as parents. That’s how the bond with pets has evolved over the years.
    From celebrating their birthdays to dressing them up in funky clothes, pets are treated just like kids.
